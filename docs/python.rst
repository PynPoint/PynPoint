Getting Started
---------------

The modular architecture of PynPoint allows for easy implementation of new pipeline modules and we welcome contributions from users. Before writing a new PynPoint module, it is helpful to have a look at the :ref:`architecture` section. In addition, some basic knowledge on Python is required and some understanding on the following items can be helpful:

    * Python |types| such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
    * |classes|, in particular the concept of inheritance.
    * |abc| as interfaces.

There are three different types of pipeline modules: :class:`~pynpoint.core.processing.ReadingModule`, :class:`~pynpoint.core.processing.WritingModule`, and :class:`~pynpoint.core.processing.ProcessingModule`. The concept is similar for the three types of modules so here we will explain only how to code a processing module.

Conventions
-----------

Before we start writing a new PynPoint module, please take notice of the following style conventions:

    * |pep8| -- style guide for Python code
    * We recommend using |pylint| and |pycodestyle| to analyze newly written code in order to keep PynPoint well structured, readable, and documented.
    * Names of class member should start with ``m_``.
    * Images should ideally not be read from and written to the central database at once but in amounts of ``MEMORY``.
