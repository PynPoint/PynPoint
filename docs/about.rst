Please also cite `Amara & Quanz (2012) <http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427..948A>`_ as the origin of PynPoint, which focused initially on the use of principal component analysis (PCA) as a PSF subtraction method. In case you use specifically the PCA-based background subtraction module or the wavelet based speckle suppression module, please give credit to `Hunziker et al. (2018) <http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...611A..23H>`_ or `Bonse, Quanz & Amara (2018) <http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180405063B>`_, respectively.
