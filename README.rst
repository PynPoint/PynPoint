PynPoint is a generic, end-to-end pipeline for the data reduction and analysis of high-contrast imaging data of planetary and substellar companions, as well as circumstellar disks in scattered light. The package is stable, has been extensively tested, and is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pynpoint/>`_. PynPoint is under continuous development so the latest implementations can be pulled from Github repository.

The pipeline has a modular architecture with a central data storage in which all results are stored by the processing modules. These modules have specific tasks such as the subtraction of the thermal background emission, frame selection, centering, PSF subtraction, and photometric and astrometric measurements. The tags from the central data storage can be written to FITS, HDF5, and text files with the available I/O modules.

To get a first impression, there is an end-to-end example available of a `SPHERE/ZIMPOL <https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/sphere.html>`_ H-alpha data set of the accreting M dwarf companion of `HD 142527 <http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A.156C>`_, which can be downloaded `here <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~stolkert/pynpoint/hd142527_zimpol_h-alpha.tgz>`_.
