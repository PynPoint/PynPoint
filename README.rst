PynPoint is a generic, end-to-end pipeline for the data reduction and analysis of high-contrast imaging data of planetary and brown dwarf companions. The package is stable, extensively tested, and actively maintained.

For a first impression, `this example <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~stolkert/pynpoint/hd142527_zimpol_h-alpha.tgz>`_ of `HD 142527B <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A.156C/abstract>`_ shows a typical workflow.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at `http://pynpoint.readthedocs.io <http://pynpoint.readthedocs.io>`_, including installation instructions, details on the pipeline architecture, and a description of all the pipeline modules and input parameters.
