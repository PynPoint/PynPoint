    Compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is formally defined as the test statistic of a
    two-sample t-test, and related quantities (such as the FPF) at a given position in an image.

    For more detailed information about the definition of the signal-to-noise ratio and the
    motivation behind it, please see the following paper:

        Mawet, D. et al. (2014): "Fundamental limitations of high contrast imaging set by small
        sample statistics". *The Astrophysical Journal*, 792(2), 97.
        DOI: `10.1088/0004-637X/792/2/97 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/792/2/97>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : numpy.ndarray
        The input image as a 2D numpy array. For example, this could be a residual frame returned by
        a :class:`.PcaPsfSubtractionModule`.
    x_pos : float
        The planet position (in pixels) along the horizontal axis. The pixel coordinates of the
        bottom-left corner of the image are (-0.5, -0.5).
    y_pos : float
        The planet position (pix) along the vertical axis. The pixel coordinates of the bottom-left
        corner of the image are (-0.5, -0.5).
    size : float
        The radius of the references apertures (in pixels). Usually, this values should be chosen
        close to lambda over D, that is, the typical FWHM of the PSF.
    ignore : bool
        Whether or not to ignore the immediate neighboring apertures for the noise estimate. This is
        desirable in case there are "self-subtraction wings" left and right of the planet which
        would bias the estimation of the noise level at the separation of the planet if not ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    signal_sum :
        The integrated (summed up) flux inside the signal aperture.

        Please note that this is **not** identical to the numerator of the fraction defining the SNR
        (which is given by the `signal_sum` minus the mean of the noise apertures).
    noise :
        The denominator of the SNR, i.e., the standard deviation of the integrated flux of the noise
        apertures, times a correction factor that accounts for small sample statistics.
    snr :
        The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as defined by Mawet et al. (2014) in eq. (8).
    fpf :
        The false positive fraction (FPF) as defined by Mawet et al. (2014) in eq. (10).
